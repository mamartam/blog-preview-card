This project was created based on a Frontend Mentor [https://www.frontendmentor.io/] challenge. The layout and design idea come from Frontend Mentor, while the code implementation is my own.

## 📦 Technologies
- HTML5 — semantic markup for structuring the content
- CSS3 — styling and layout
- Flexbox — for layout alignment and centering elements
- Mobile-first workflow — responsive design starting from smaller screens
- Media Queries — to adapt the layout for different screen sizes
- Google Fonts (Figtree) — custom typography
- CSS Transitions — hover effects for better user interaction
- Accessibility features:
  - `:focus-visible` styles for keyboard navigation
  - `prefers-reduced-motion` support to reduce animations when requested
 
## 💻 The Process
First, I downloaded all the required files provided by the Frontend Mentor platform, including the Figma design, image assets, and project guidelines.

After reviewing all the materials, I planned my workflow and decided on the best approach to build the page. I started by creating a project folder on my local computer, setting up the HTML and CSS files, and organizing a separate folder for images.

Next, I built the basic HTML structure and added all the content that would appear on the page. Once the structure was ready, I applied styles based on the provided design, focusing on layout, typography, and spacing.

During the development process, I learned the importance of building websites using a mobile-first approach, starting with styles for smaller screens and then adapting the layout for larger devices. I also discovered the value of accessibility features, such as supporting reduced motion preferences, so users who prefer less animation can have a more comfortable experience.

## 📚 What I Learned

- The importance of a mobile-first approach when creating responsive designs
- How to use media queries to adapt layouts for different screen sizes
- How to work with `rem` units for better scalability and accessibility
- How to apply hover and focus-visible states to improve user interaction
- How to support accessibility features such as `prefers-reduced-motion`
- How to translate a Figma design into a functional web page using CSS

## 🚀 How It Can Be Improved?

- Refactor class names to follow a consistent naming methodology (e.g. BEM) for better scalability and maintainability
- Add more interactive states for the button, including hover and active styles
